Deployment Plan

Overview

The file-sharing system is deployed using Docker and AWS ECS for scalability and reliability.

Steps





Containerization:





Build Docker image: docker build -t file-sharing-api .



Test locally: docker run -p 5000:5000 file-sharing-api



Cloud Setup:





AWS ECR: Push Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry.



AWS ECS: Deploy using Fargate for serverless scaling.



MongoDB: Use MongoDB Atlas or AWS DocumentDB.



S3: Store files in AWS S3 instead of local storage.



Secrets: Store SECRET_KEY and Fernet key in AWS Secrets Manager.



CI/CD:





Use GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy to ECR/ECS on code push.



Security:





Enable HTTPS via AWS Application Load Balancer.



Restrict MongoDB and S3 access to ECS security group.



Rotate encryption keys periodically.



Monitoring:





Use AWS CloudWatch for logs and performance metrics.



Set alerts for errors or high latency.



Scaling:





Configure ECS auto-scaling based on CPU/memory.



Use S3 for scalable file storage.

Notes





Set environment variables in ECS task definitions.



Test in staging before production.



Back up MongoDB and S3 regularly.
